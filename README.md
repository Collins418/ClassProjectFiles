<u><i>PROJECT TITLE</i></u>

<h1> Daily Delight üç∏ </h1> 

<br>

<u><i>DESCRIPTION</i></u>

Project 1 by the group Runtime-Terror will be an app that makes drink recommendations based on the weather.

<br>


<u><i>USER STORY</i></u>

As a responsible adult, I want the app to recommend me a beverage based on the current weather conditions.

WHEN I open the app THEN I can confirm I am 21 years or older SO THAT the company is not liable for encouraging underage drinking
WHEN I enter my location THEN the application will pull weather data SO THAT the app can recommend me a beverage
WHEN I am shown a beverage THEN I can select if I like the recommendation or not SO THAT the app can recommend something else if I don't like it
